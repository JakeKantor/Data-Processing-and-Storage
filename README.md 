#How to Run the Code
To run this code, you will need Python installed on your system. No additional libraries are required for the basic functionality.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing in_memory_db.py.
3. Run the script using Python from your terminal:

```python
# Create a new instance of the database
db = InMemoryDB()

# Start a transaction
db.begin_transaction()

# Add some key-value pairs
db.put("name", "Alice")
db.put("age", 30)

# Retrieve a value
print(db.get("name"))  # Output: Alice
print(db.get("age"))   # Output: 30
#Future Assignment Considerations
Additional methods for delete operations and multi-threaded support could simulate concurrent transactions. Methods to handle conflicts when multiple transactions attempt to modify the same key could be included. Having event listener to allow users to register callbacks for certain events, such as on commit or on rollback.
